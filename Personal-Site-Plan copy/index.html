      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>

        highlighting my skills, projects, and professional growth. This platform will serve as a central hub for potential 
        employers and collaborators to explore my work and understand my capabilities in creating modern, responsive web applications.
      </p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        This website is designed for tech companies and potential employers looking for web development talent,

      <h2>Dynamic Elements</h2>
      <p>
        The website will incorporate the following JavaScript features to enhance user experience:
      </p>
      <p>
        1. Interactive Project Gallery: Using DOM manipulation and event listeners to create a filterable
        project showcase. Users can filter projects by technology or type, with smooth transitions and
        dynamic content loading.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Form Validation and Submission: The contact form will use JavaScript for real-time validation,
        providing immediate feedback to users. This demonstrates conditional branching and DOM interaction.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Dynamic Theme Switcher: Implementation of a dark/light theme toggle using JavaScript objects
        to store theme preferences in local storage, showing object usage and DOM modification.
      </p>
      <p>
        4. Skill Progress Visualization: Using JavaScript arrays and array methods (map, forEach) to
        create animated skill progress bars and dynamic content updates.
      </p>
      <p>
        5. ES Modules: The JavaScript code will be organized into modules for better maintainability,
        with separate files for utilities, components, and main functionality.
      </p>
